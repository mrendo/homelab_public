# 🚀 Welcome to the Lab

Hey 👋  
I’m **Mr EnDo** (aka **Luke**) — IT professional, lifelong geek, and unapologetic homelabber.

Over the years I’ve been building, breaking, rebuilding, and *over-engineering* my home lab. Along the way I realised a lot of the base configs, patterns, and lessons learned might actually be useful to others — so this repo exists to share the foundations of my homelab with the wider community.

The goal here isn’t perfection — it’s learning, iteration, and collaboration.

---

## 🤝 Community Driven

If you’ve got improvements, fixes, or ideas:

- Open a **pull request**
- Start a **discussion**
- Fork it and make it your own

I’d love for this to grow into a small but useful community resource for people on their own homelab journeys.

## 📊 What’s in Here (So Far)

To kick things off, I’m sharing my **Observability Stack**, built around:

- **Grafana** – dashboards & visualisation  
- **Loki** – log aggregation  
- **Prometheus** – metrics & alerting  
- **Alertmanager** – notifications & routing  


---

## 🧪 Expect

- Real-world configs  
- Opinionated defaults  
- Evolving setups  
- A bias toward Linux, containers, and automation  

If it helps you — awesome.  
If you improve it — even better.
